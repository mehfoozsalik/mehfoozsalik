A multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy meeting new people and understanding how they are solving problems, this is one of the reasons why I invest my time in meetups from product management to everything related to design (Research, design thinking, Problem to Solution, design system, Programming, etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an opportunity to learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve myself as a professional and put things into practice when I’m creating my solutions.
