Hello There! <br/>
My name is Mehfooz Salik. I am a Software Engineer. I see Engineering as a way to make life easier and better for people. It’s not only about how things made, but also about how they work and solve real problems. I enjoy working with others, learning from different ideas, and turning them into clear and useful solutions. What I like most is that design and technology keep changing, giving me new chances to grow and improve my work.
